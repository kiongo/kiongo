Hi, I am Robert Kiongo and am currently learning Python by watching Youtube video tutorials and reading any relevant material I can get my hands on. 
My pursuit is inspired by the realization that AI will play an increasingly significant role in ecommerce, social media, governance, entertainment, education, environmental management, security, and a myriad other aspects of today's tech-centric humanity.
My primary reason for joining Github is thus to seek benefficial interactions in this increasingly important field, i.e.,to find mentors, innovators, hobbyists, and other practitioners of the Python programming language.
I am also aware that Github is the bonafide source of Python-related material, from PDFs on the subject to real-life application source code.
